# JavaMicroservices-Training

Hi Guys,
I am maintaining this repository for Java-Microservices training!
If you would like to contribute, please go through the project folder/file structure & naming conventions.

For example, if you would like to work on `Annotation` module.

##### Please gothrough the example
    1. Create a new package as follows, if already doesn't exist
        com.infy.<packagename> (e.g. com.infy.annotation)

    2. Inside the package create 3 files as follows, if already don't exist
        <ModuleName-Notes.txt>  (e.g. Annotation-Notes.txt)
        <ModuleName-MCQ.txt>    (e.g. Annotation-MCQ.txt)
        <ModuleName.java>       (e.g. AnnotationDemo.java) (should contain main() method)

> Note:  Please create new `module` inside `JavaMicroservices-Training/Java-Beyond-Basic/JavaBeyondBasicCodeBase/src/com/infy` folder only.

> Refere `modules/packages` [path][path].
